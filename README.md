This is Focus.
and it is still very much a WIP.

a 3rd person combat game with ragdoll physics and fun combat with a FOCUS. mode allow you to deal devastating impacts to enemies.
this is my Capstone project, something that I really wanted was a fluid and powerful combat system and finding animations to fit that was a challenge but I feel like I found it
I love ragdoll within video games and what they bring to the table, seeing a body go flying is hilarious yet gives your a bit of a power trip I think can be intoxicating while playing a game
I really wanted this game to feel super flowy and rewarding and its somewhat of a tech demo for myself for a bit of combat.

Enjoy my personal capstone project!
